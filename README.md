# FSRandomizer
FSRandomizer allows you to create your own career in Clone Hero with the entire Guitar Hero series scaled by difficulty (with some surprises!) so that revisitting the games is as fun and exciting as playing career for the first time!

# Notes

Master FC Breakdown created by Phase 1 in Deprecated.

Removed Ted Nugent and Zakk Wylde guitar battle from the FS to make an even 660 songs\
Due to Clone Hero having no "battle" in Quickplay or career mode to simulate those,\
The WT battles are charts that are really hard to find as well
