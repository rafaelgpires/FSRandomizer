# FSRandomizer
FSRandomizer allows you to create your own career in Clone Hero with the entire Guitar Hero series scaled by difficulty (with some surprises!) so that revisitting the games is as fun and exciting as playing career for the first time!

# To Do
Phase 2: Replace 10% with a modulus of 5? For however many times $songcount is a multiple of 5, add an encore?

# Notes

Ran Phase 1 in a per-game basis to help determine thresholds for %s in difficulty ratings for each game.\
The individual lists were saved in the Phase 1 Folder.

Phase 2/3/4 are deprecated since the creation of "Web GH Lister" for public use, Phase 1 is still useful for FC Breakdowns.\
Phase 2 has been replaced with a web-only version.\
Phase 3 has been replaced with a C++ app attached to the web.\
Phase 4 has been integrated in the C++ app as well.

Removed Ted Nugent and Zakk Wylde guitar battle from the FS to make an even 660 songs\
Due to Clone Hero having no "battle" in Quickplay or career mode to simulate those,\
The WT battles are charts that are really hard to find as well
